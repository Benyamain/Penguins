<Journal Entry #1>

When the team was formed, we aimed to select a project feasible within the outlined project timeline and requirements. We had a few projects in mind, listed in order of preference as fallback plans. Primarily, we wanted to invest in a multi-objective reinforcement learning project. Initially, the team agreed on using a project to simulate emergent intelligence in agents. However, this carried more risk in terms of feasibility. I acknowledged the risks but believed we would learn more from our other project. Besides the emergent intelligence agent, the second project, which my teammates also agreed on, was multi-objective reinforcement learning. This project addresses scenarios with more than two objective functions. We planned to express this project in Unity, creating a reinforcement learning environment using the ML-Agents toolkit compatible with the Unity game engine. This setup would provide gymnasium environments where we could train our defined actors with our objective functions and hyperparameters. Our defined actor is a penguin whose primary objective is to feed its baby penguin. The penguin searches for food, and when it successfully feeds the baby, the agent receives a reward. To add urgency, a timer shows how long the simulation has been running.

Setting this up could be challenging, so we need to ensure compatibility across all machines, allowing everyone to contribute. This is our main focus for the next two weeks. Once everyone can access the environment with specific configurations, we can move forward and make progress. At that point, we will consider a secondary objective function to simulate energy preservation. We could attach a health system to the penguin, where more movements lead to energy depletion, resulting in a small penalty. This penalty would be minor, encouraging the agent to balance energy conservation with the primary objective of feeding its baby. If possible, we aim for a third objective function, such as the agent fighting off another critic agent. However, this depends on time and feasibility.
