# Penguins

A Unity project that teaches penguins to swim around, find fish within the environment, and bring the fish back to feed their babies!

The penguin was trained with reinforcement learning to make decisions and swim around.

You can find the [demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91TM5UHDzzU) here!

Navigate to `Setup/CondaEnvironment/` and create your respective conda environment by running:

```conda env create -f environment.yml```
